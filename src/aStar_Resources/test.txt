BACKGROUND

The A* Path Finding Algorithm is a series
of instructions which allow for the 
traversal of ordered 'nodes'(which may 
contain obstacles) the goal being to find 
the quickest possible route.


INSTRUCTIONS

The GREEN node on the grid is the 
starting point and it's RED counter part 
is the ending point. You may move these 
points anywhere on the grid you would 
like, by simply pressing down on the 
desired point and dragging it to where 
you wish. Similarly you can create
obstacles as well by pressing and dragging. 
To start the path finding, press 'start'. 
If you want to tweak something, press 
'clear path'. Otherwise to start again, 
press 'reset'.
